### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


As a junior web developer and social communicator, I am an up-and-coming professional in the field of technology, with a solid foundation in web development and a focus on learning and growing in my career. Although my background and previous experience may differ from the typical web developer profile, I am committed to my growth and development in this exciting and ever-evolving area.

Currently, my tech profile meets the technical knowledge for configuring, routing, and deploying HTTP servers using technologies such as Node.js and Express. Likewise, direct connection with databases in PostgreSQL and MongoDB systems. On the client side, my skills are developed in the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
